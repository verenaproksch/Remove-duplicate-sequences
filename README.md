## Python script to remove duplicate sequences from an input file and put the unique sequences in an output file
The Python script removes duplicate sequences from an input FASTA file and writes the unique sequences to an output file. 
It also provides the option to summarize the number of sequences in the input and output file.
### To run this script, the following command line has to be entered in the terminal:
```
python Project_6.py input_file output_file [-ci] [-co]
```

In this case, Azolla_filiculoides.genome_v1.2_rRNA will be used as the input file.

Any empty fasta file can be used as an output file. 

The option -ci can be used to print the number of sequences in the input file.

The option -co can be used to print the number of unique sequences/sequences in the output file.
